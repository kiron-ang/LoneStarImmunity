Hi, Dr. Wilkerson!

Initially, I wanted to use Tableau to create an interactive visualization for this assignment.
However, I became frustrated by the lack of control offered. So, I created a website using GitHub Pages
and implemented a data visualization with the D3 JavaScript library. Please view my interactive
visualization at kiron-ang.github.io/LoneStarImmunity.

The dataset, available at www.dshs.texas.gov/immunizations/data/school/coverage,

Concerning the colors of the app, I selected my palette from the visual identity of the Texas 
Department of Transportation: www.txdot.gov/about/brand-guidelines/visual-identity/colors.html.

My code for this assignment is available at github.com/kiron-ang/LoneStarImmunity. Thank you for your 
time and evaluation.

Sincerely,

Kiron Ang
